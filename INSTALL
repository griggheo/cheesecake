Cheesecake can be installed in two ways: either via downloading a
Cheesecake package and installing it yourself, or using easy_install.

============
Requirements
============

To make Cheesecake score maximally reliable make sure you have
both `pylint <http://www.logilab.org/projects/pylint>`_ and
`setuptools <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools>`_
installed.

===================
Manual installation
===================

If you have downloaded a Cheesecake package, follow this steps:

1) Unpack it::

    tar zxf cheesecake-0.6.tar.gz

2) Change to the cheesecake directory::

    cd cheesecake-0.6/

3) Run setup.py that will install Cheesecake automatically. This step
   need to be run as root::

    python setup.py install

==================
Using easy_install
==================

If you have `easy_install <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall>`_
on your system, installing Cheesecake is as simple as running::

    easy_install cheesecake

Note: if you already have an old version of Cheesecake installed, easy_install
will not automatically download the latest version. You can ask for a particular
version by running for example::

    easy_install Cheesecake==0.6

If you're feeling adventurous you may install development version::

    easy_install Cheesecake==dev
